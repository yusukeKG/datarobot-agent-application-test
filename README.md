This repository provides a ready-to-use application template for building and deploying agentic workflows with
multi-agent frameworks, a fastapi backend server, a react frontend, and an MCP server. The template
streamlines the process of setting up new workflows with minimal configuration requirements.
They support local development and testing, as well as one-command deployments to production environments
within DataRobot.

### Development Container (experimental)

[devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) allows using a container environment for local development experience. It is integrated with
[modern IDEs, such as VSCode and PyCharm](https://containers.dev/supporting), and [Dev Container CLI](https://containers.dev/supporting#devcontainer-cli) allows you to integrate it with Terminal-centric development experience.

> This can also be used as a solution for Windows development.

```diff
-[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is the recomended backend for running devcontainers, but any docker-compatible backend is supported.
```

This template offers a devcontainer with all pre-requisites installed. To start working in it, simply open the template in PyCharm (version >= 2023.2, Pro) or VSCode, and IDE will prompt you to re-open in a container:

![Open in Dev Container PyCharm](docs/img/pycharm-devcontainer.png)

![Open in Dev Container VSCode](docs/img/vscode-devcontainer.png)


If you work directly in the terminal, do:

```shell
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . /bin/sh
```

## Prepare application

As the last step, enter `dr start` to prepare your local development environment. An interactive wizard will guide you though selection of configuration options

<details>

<summary>☂️ Configuration options explained</summary>

## LLM configuration

Agentic Application supports multiple flexible LLM options including:

- LLM Blueprint with LLM Gateway (default)
- LLM Blueprint with an External LLM
- Already Deployed Text Generation model in DataRobot

### LLM Configuration Recommended Option

You can edit the LLM configuration by manually changing which configuration is active.
Simply run:

```sh
ln -sf ../configurations/<chosen_configuration> infra/infra/llm.py
```

After doing so, you'll likely want to edit the llm.py to have the correct model selected. Particularly
for non-LLM Gateway options.

### LLM Configuration Alternative Option

If you want to do it dynamically, you can set it as a configuration value with:

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=<chosen_configuration>
```

from the list of options in the `infra/configurations/llm` folder.

Here are some examples of each configuration using the dynamic option described above:

#### LLM Blueprint with LLM Gateway (default)

Default option is LLM Gateway if not specified in your `.env` file.

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=blueprint_with_llm_gateway.py
```

#### Existing LLM Deployment in DataRobot

Uncomment and configure these in your `.env` file:

```sh
TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID=<your_deployment_id>
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=deployed_llm.py
```

#### External LLM Provider

Configure an LLM with an external LLM provider like Azure, Bedrock, Anthropic, or VertexAI. Here's an Azure AI example:

```sh
INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=blueprint_with_external_llm.py
LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL="azure/gpt-4o"
OPENAI_API_VERSION='2024-08-01-preview'
OPENAI_API_BASE='https://<your_custom_endpoint>.openai.azure.com'
OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID='<your deployment_id>'
OPENAI_API_KEY='<your_api_key>'
```

See the [DataRobot documentation](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/gen-ai/playground-tools/deploy-llm.html) for details on other providers.

In addition to the changes for the `.env` file, you can also edit the respective llm.py file to make additional changes
such as the default LLM, temperature, top_p, etc within the chosen configuration


## OAuth Applications

The template can work with files stored in Google Drive and Box.
In order to give it access to those files, you need to configure OAuth Applications.

### Google OAuth Application

- Go to [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) from your Google account
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services" > "Enable APIs and services" search for Drive, and add it.
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen" and make sure you have your consent screen configured. You may have both "External" and "Internal" audience types.
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and click on the "Create Credentials" button. Select "OAuth client ID".
- Select "Web application" as Application type, fill in "Name" & "Authorized redirect URIs" fields. For example, for local development, the redirect URL will be:
  - `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback` - local vite dev server (used by frontend folks)
  - `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` - web-proxied frontend
  - `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/oauth/callback/` - the local web API (optional).
  - For production, you'll want to add your DataRobot callback URL. For example, in US Prod it is `https://app.datarobot.com/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`. For any installation of DataRobot it is `https://<datarobot-endpoint>/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`.
- Hit the "Create" button when you are done.
- Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" values from the created OAuth client ID and set them in the template env variables as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` correspondingly.
- Make sure you have the "Google Drive API" enabled in the "APIs & Services" > "Library" section. Otherwise, you will get 403 errors.
- Finally, go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen" > "Data Access" and make sure you have the following scopes selected:
  - `openid`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`

### Box OAuth Application

- Head to [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) from your Box account
- Create a new platform application, then select "Custom App" type
- Fill in "Application Name" and select "Purpose" (e.g. "Integration"). Then, fill in three more info fields. The actual selection doesn't matter.
- Select "User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)" as Authentication Method and click on the "Create App" button
- In the "OAuth 2.0 Redirect URIs" section, please fill in callback URLs you want to use.
  - `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback` - local vite dev server (used by frontend folks)
  - `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` - web-proxied frontend
  - `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/oauth/callback/` - the local web API (optional).
  - For production, you'll want to add your DataRobot callback URL. For example, in US Prod it is `https://app.datarobot.com/custom_applications/{appId}/oauth/callback`.
- Hit "Save Changes" after that.
- Under the "Application Scopes", please make sure you have both `Read all files and folders stored in Box` and "Write all files and folders store in Box" checkboxes selected. We need both because we need to "write" to the log that we've downloaded the selected files.
- Finally, under the "OAuth 2.0 Credentials" section, you should be able to find your Client ID and Client Secret pair to setup in the template env variables as `BOX_CLIENT_ID` and `BOX_CLIENT_SECRET` correspondingly.

After you've set those in your project `.env` file, on the next Pulumi Up, we'll create OAuth
providers in your DataRobot installation. To view and manage those and verify they are working
navigate to `<your_datarobot_url>/account/oauth-providers` or in US production: https://app.datarobot.com/account/oauth-providers.

Additionally, the Pulumi output variables get used to populate those providers for your Codespace and
local development environment as well.

# Run your agent

## Option 1: autoreload for backend, static frontend

Build the frontend:
```shell
task frontend_web:build
```

Start the Mcp Server:

```shell
task mcp_server:dev
```

Start the application:

```shell
task web:dev
```

Start the writer agent:

```shell
task writer_agent:dev
```

And go to http://localhost:8080.

## Option 2: autoreload for all components

Instead of `task frontend_web:build` do `task frontend_web:dev`, and go to http://localhost:5173/

## Option 3 (experimental): just agent playground

If you want to test just the agent without application you can do:

```shell

task writer_agent:dev
```

then:
```shell
task writer_agent:chainlit
```

This will start a separate frontend application just for your local agent at http://localhost:8083/.
